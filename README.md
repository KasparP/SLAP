Software for operating the SLAP microscope

This codebase operates a fast two-photon microscope developed by the Podgorski Lab.
The best way to get started is to try out the demos in the /Demos directory.

Designs for the microscope are free for research purposes. For hardware documentation and licensing information, visit: https://www.janelia.org/open-science/kilohertz-frame-rate-tomographic-2-photon-microscope
