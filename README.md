# SLAP
Software for operating the SLAP microscope

This code operates a fast two-photon microscope developed by the Podgorski Lab.
The best way to get started is to try out the demos in the /demos directory.

See Kazemipour et al, Nature Methods volume 16, pages 778â€“786 (2019)
Code in the first commit to this repository was developed by Abbas Kazemipour, Kaspar Podgorski, and Jonathan King

Designs for the microscope are available free for research purposes. For hardware documentation and licensing information, visit: https://www.janelia.org/open-science/kilohertz-frame-rate-tomographic-2-photon-microscope
