Software for operating the SLAP microscope

This code operates a fast two-photon microscope developed by the Podgorski Lab.
The best way to get started is to try out the demos in the /demos directory.

Designs for the microscope are available free for research purposes. For hardware documentation and licensing information, visit: https://www.janelia.org/open-science/kilohertz-frame-rate-tomographic-2-photon-microscope
